# Welcome to my personal website

This a personal website designed to host some featured projects of my career.

## WebGL Demos

### [Amusement Park in WebGL](AmusementPark/index-en.html)
I developed this project when I was in college at the course "graphic systems". There we learnt about 3D models, rotations, translations, 4D spaces, light models, shaders, and more. We used Javascript and WebGL to code several projects. This one was my final project, and the professors selected it as a featured project hosted in the course website. 

### [KeplerOrbit](KeplerOrbit/index.html)
I developed this WebGL demo when I was preparing for my Thesis defence. It helps explaining astronomical terminology and classical elements of a Keplerian orbit, as it draws the Earth, the satellite, its orbit, some common frames and reference objects used in my Thesis work. I also used it to take screenshots to enhance some parts of the report.

This work was performed within the framework of a collaboration agreement between FIUBA and CoNAE (Argentine Space Activities National Agency), through GPSIC (Signal Processing, Identification and Control Group).
