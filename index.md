# Welcome to my personal website

This a personal website designed to host some featured projects of my career.
I am an Electronic Engineer graduated from the University of Buenos Aires.
In this web you can take a look at my projects, download my Curriculum Vitae and also my Thesis report.

## WebGL Demos

### [Amusement Park in WebGL](AmusementPark/index-en.html)
I developed this project when I was in college at the course "graphic systems". There we learnt about 3D models, rotations, translations, 4D spaces, light models, shaders, and more. We used Javascript and WebGL to code several projects. This one was my final project, and the professors selected it as a featured project hosted in the course website.

### [KeplerOrbit](KeplerOrbit/index.html)
I developed this WebGL demo when I was preparing for my Thesis defence. It helps explaining astronomical terminology and classical elements of a Keplerian orbit, as it draws the Earth, the satellite, its orbit, some common frames and reference objects used in my Thesis work. I also used it to take screenshots to enhance some parts of the report.

## [Thesis](Thesis/SLSampayo-Tesis_10Nov16.pdf)
**Title**: "Guidance, Navigation and Control System for injection of small satellite into LEO (low-Earth orbit)" 
**Advisor**: Dr. Eng. Juan I. Giribet

This work was performed within the framework of a collaboration agreement between FIUBA and CoNAE (Argentine Space Activities National Agency), through GPSIC (Signal Processing, Identification and Control Group).

## Self-Driving Car Engineering Projects

These projects were done through the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree course.

### Behavioral Cloning

![Simulator][behavioral]

Here I built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. I used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks. This methods turned out successfully, since I managed to keep the car stay on the road in a completely new scenario all along the track. There is a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/xRBW0KxH8AY) where you can watch how it drove in that case.

### Vehicle Detection and Tracking

![Heatmap][vehicleDet]

In this project I created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). I also optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/zxqPGv7t-no).
